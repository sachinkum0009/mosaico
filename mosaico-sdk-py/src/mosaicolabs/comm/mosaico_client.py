Mosaico Client Entry Point.

This module provides the `MosaicoClient`, the primary interface for users to
interact with the Mosaico system. It manages the connection lifecycle,
resource pooling (connections and executors), and serves as a factory for
creating resource handlers (sequences, topics) and executing queries.
