Base Model Module.

This module defines the foundational class for all data models within the SDK.
It bridges the gap between Pydantic (used for runtime data validation and Pythonic interaction)
and PyArrow (used for efficient wire transport and columnar storage).

    PyArrow structure (`__msco_pyarrow_struct__`), enabling the SDK to auto-generate

    implementation where other fields mapping and checks are implemented
