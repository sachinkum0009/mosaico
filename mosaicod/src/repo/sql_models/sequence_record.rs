//! This module provides the data access and minimal business logics for managing
//! **Sequences** within the application repository.
//!
//! A Sequence represents a named, persistent entity in the system, often associated
//! with a physical data stream or a collection of topics. It includes methods for
//! creating, retrieving, and managing the state (e.g., locking) of these records.
//!
//! All database operations accept a type that implements `sqlx::Executor`, allowing
//! them to be executed directly against a connection pool or within a transaction.
