## Mosaico

Mosaico is an open-source data platform specifically designed for Robotics and Physical AI.

This repo contains both the Python SDK (`mosaico-sdk-py`) and the Rust backend (`mosaicod`). We have chosen to keep the code in a monorepo configuration to simplify the testing and reduce compatibility issues.

> [!WARNING]
> **Mosaico is currently in an early development phase.**
>
> This software is not ready for production environments. 
> Until the release of version **1.0**, the API, inner mechanisms and naming are subject to significant changes without notice.

Mosaico takes a strictly code-first approach. 
We didn't want to force you to learn yet another SQL-like sublanguage just to move data around. 
Instead, we provide native SDKs (starting with Python) so you can query and upload data using the programming language you are already comfortable with. You can start exploring the [Python SDK documentation](./mosaico-sdk-py/README.md).

Under the hood, the system operates on a standard client-server model. 
The server daemon, [`mosaicod`](mosaicod/README.md), acts as the central hub that takes care of the heavy lifting, like data conversion, compression, and organized storage. 
On the other side, the client SDK is what you actually import into your scripts; it manages the communication logic and abstracts away the implementation details to keep your API usage stable, even as the platform evolves in the background.

For a deep dive into the platform's architecture read the [Core Concepts Guide](CORE_CONCEPTS.md).

### Quick Start

You can start experimenting with Mosaico using the provided Docker Compose configuration (directory `docker/quick_start`).

```bash
cd docker/quick_start
docker compose up -d
```

This starts a Postgres instance on the default port `5432`, compiles Mosaico from source into a new Docker image, and runs it.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The default Mosaico configuration uses non persistent storage. 
> This means that if the container is destroyed, all stored data will be lost.
> Since Mosaico is still under active development, we provide this simple, volatile setup by default. 
> For persistent storage, the standard `compose.yml` file can be easily extended to utilize a Docker volume.

To install the provided Python SDK and its dependencies, first navigate in the repository root directory and then run the following commands:

```bash
cd mosaico-sdk-py
poetry install
```

### Testing

To run the testing pipeline use the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/test_suite.sh
```

The testing pipeline requires [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) toolchain, and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

The testing pipeline contains all the unit tests (server + SDKs) and integration tests.
